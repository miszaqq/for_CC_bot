This version of the solution was written to be as minimalistic as possible.
Assumptions are that user will follow the instructions and submit positive INT as an input.
No checks are introduced in this code, but this can be done using .isdecimal or try/except.
Reusable build-in function range(start, stop, step) has been used instead, this is done in order to reduce code repetition
