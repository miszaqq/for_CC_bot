# in first line of this code we take input from user using just one line, so the inputs must be separated by 'space',
# then inputs are being converted into INT type
# in the second line of the code we print results which are lists, and the results are being calculated using
# reusable range built-in function

# this code has been made to be as minimalistic as possible, so there were no checks introduced,
# I assume that user must follow instructions and provide int type as an input
# checks can be introduced in the form of .isdecimal or using try / except to try to convert input to required type
